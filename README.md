# My C Project

## Overview
This project is a simple C application that demonstrates the structure of a C program, including the use of header files and a Makefile for building the project.

## Project Structure
```
my-c-project
├── src
│   └── main.c
├── include
│   └── main.h
├── Makefile
└── README.md
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install a C Compiler**: Ensure you have a C compiler installed (e.g., GCC).
2. **Create Project Directory**: Create a directory named `my-c-project` and navigate into it.
3. **Create Subdirectories**: Inside `my-c-project`, create two subdirectories: `src` and `include`.
4. **Create Source and Header Files**: 
   - Create `main.c` in the `src` directory.
   - Create `main.h` in the `include` directory.
5. **Create Makefile**: In the root of the project, create a `Makefile` with rules to compile the project.
6. **Write Code**: Implement your C code in `main.c` and declare necessary functions in `main.h`.
7. **Build the Project**: Open a terminal, navigate to the project directory, and run `make` to compile the project.
8. **Run the Executable**: After building, run the executable generated by the Makefile (usually named `a.out` or specified in the Makefile).
9. **Check Output**: Verify that the program runs as expected and produces the correct output.

## Usage
To use this project, follow the setup instructions above, then modify the source files as needed to implement your desired functionality. After making changes, rebuild the project using `make` and run the executable to see the results.
